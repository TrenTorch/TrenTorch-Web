// Flat id -> question lookup, and a GLOBAL full-path -> question lookup
// for resolving a question's cross-question test dependencies -- see
// strip-load-solution-boilerplate.ts. The full path (sectionFolder/
// trackFolder/folder) is what a load_solution("...") call's string
// argument actually names, exactly mirroring data/app_data/_load.py's
// own resolution (see that file's docstring: paths are deliberately
// section/track/folder-qualified so no two tracks' "01-..." folders can
// ever collide with each other). A dependency lookup keyed by bare
// folder name alone -- and scoped to only the current question's own
// track -- silently fails the moment a question depends on a DIFFERENT
// track's solution (a common, deliberate pattern across this
// curriculum, e.g. 04-ensembles/06-adaboost depending on
// 03-decision-trees/03-best-split-minimal-tree).
