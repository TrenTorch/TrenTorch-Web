"""
Regenerates the "Team Engineers" avatar grid directly inside README.md from
real GitHub data (issues raised, PRs raised) for every contributor
discovered from the repo's PR and issue history. Renders an avatar grid
(the good part of the all-contributors project's UI) with plain-text stats
instead of an emoji contribution-type key (the part we're deliberately not
copying). Preserves each person's existing hand-written intro line; a
first-time contributor gets a generic placeholder intro instead of a
fabricated bio, since nobody should get credentials invented for them.

This used to write a separate docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md, with a hand-maintained
"Team Engineers" table duplicated (and already drifted -- missing a real
contributor, no PR/issue counts) directly in README.md alongside it. Two
places to keep in sync is how it drifted in the first place -- now there's
one real table, generated, living where people actually look for it.

Run by .github/workflows/update-contributors.yml, authenticated with
GITHUB_TOKEN via the gh CLI (already configured by actions/checkout /
the workflow's GH_TOKEN env var).
